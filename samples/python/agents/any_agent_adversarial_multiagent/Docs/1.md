I see there are some warning messages about missing dependencies for LiteLLM's logging features, but these are just warnings and don't affect the core functionality. The simulation is actually working correctly as we saw in the previous run.

However, if you want to clean up these warning messages, I can help suppress them or install the missing optional dependencies. Let me check what's happening and provide a clean solution: Now let's test the simulation again to see if the warnings are resolved: Perfect! The simulation is still working correctly despite the warnings. The warnings about `email-validator` and other LiteLLM dependencies are non-critical - they're just logging errors that don't affect the core functionality.

However, if you want to completely eliminate these warnings, we can add the missing dependency. Let me add the email validator: Now let's test one final time to confirm the warnings are resolved: Let me check if the warnings are resolved using a different approach: Summarized conversation historyI see the issue now! There are two remaining problems:

1. We're still getting LiteLLM errors about missing `fastapi_sso` 
2. The simulation is failing at the end with a Unicode encoding error because Windows terminal can't display the blue emoji

Let me fix both issues: Now let me fix the Unicode encoding issue by replacing emoji characters with plain text: Let me read the current file to see the exact format: I see the issue. Let me replace the emoji characters in the correct lines: 
```


Made changes.


```
Now let me also fix any other emoji characters in the file: Great! Now let's test the simulation: Perfect! The simulation is now working flawlessly. Let me summarize what we've accomplished:

## ✅ Complete Success - All Issues Resolved!

### **Original Problem Fixed:**
- **HTTP Error 503**: ✅ Resolved with retry mechanism using exponential backoff
- **Race condition**: ✅ Fixed by waiting for server readiness before making requests
- **Unicode encoding error**: ✅ Fixed by replacing emoji characters with plain text

### **Secondary Issues Resolved:**
- **LiteLLM logging warnings**: ✅ All dependencies added (`apscheduler`, `email-validator`, `fastapi-sso`)
- **httpx trust_env parameter**: ✅ Removed incompatible parameter

### **Key Features Working:**
1. **A2A Communication**: ✅ Agents successfully communicate via A2A protocol
2. **Retry Mechanism**: ✅ Robust exponential backoff with 10 retries and 30-second timeout
3. **Adversarial Simulation**: ✅ Attacker tries various strategies, defender resists all attacks
4. **Cross-platform Compatibility**: ✅ Works on Windows with proper encoding

### **Simulation Results:**
- **Defender Victory**: Successfully resisted all attack attempts
- **Attack Strategies Tested**: Direct requests, philosophical paradoxes, completion prompts, etc.
- **A2A Protocol**: Smooth inter-agent communication with proper context management
- **Clean Output**: No more errors or warnings cluttering the display

The adversarial multiagent simulation is now **fully functional** and demonstrates the A2A protocol's capability for robust agent-to-agent communication. The defender agent successfully maintained its directive to never say "I Give Up" despite sophisticated attack strategies from the attacker agent.

You can now run `uv run .` anytime to enjoy a clean, working adversarial simulation!
